# Roadmap
This is a list of planned features for the game.

## Dungeons
* Randomly generated dungeons
* Multiple different dungeons with different tilesets/enemies
* Bosses

## Equipment
This includes armors, accessories, etc. There may be a bit of randomness to this as well, like armor can have attributes that boost certain kinds of magic, or give you a little more life.

## Leveling
Enemies will give EXP when slain, and on level-up, stats will increase. I'm considering either a "free point" to raise any one stat of the character, or perhaps handle this instead with rare items that boost a stat on consumption.

## Spell System
Parts of the dyslexinomicon can be found in the dungeon, they can then be crafted into spells, mixing and matching patterns, elements, and modifiers

### Patterns
* Straight shot
* Wave
* Beam
* Eruption (Imagine lightning striking random tiles, or rocks falling randomly)

### Elements (Each more/less effective on certain enemies)
* Fire
* Ice
* Lightning
* Earth
* Wind

### Modifiers
* Potent factor, fire can inflict burning
* Life steal
* Less mana usage

### Misc
* Healing spell
* Cure spell
* Stat buffs
* Teleport

## Town
* A shop with rotating stock
* An item storage
* Quests

## Familiars
I'm not entirely sold on how to best handle this. I'm considering a "mag" system akin to PSO. Essentially you'd feed it different items, like potions, and it'd raise certain stats. The "mag" can then evolve into different forms based on which stats were upgraded, and will provide stat boosts depending on what levels the mag is at.
