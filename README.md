# Dyshexia
> A rouge-like game featuring randomly generated spells

## Engine
This game was created using love2d, in conjunction with my own engine, [Heartbeat](https://github.com/taizweb/heartbeat).

## Running the Game
Eventually there will be releases for Windows, macOS, and Linux, likely on July 5th. You can also just clone the repository and run it with love2d, which brings us to...

## Requirements/Installation
* Lua (v5.3) - Get it from your package manager, or from the [site itself](https://www.lua.org/download.html)
* love2d (v11.1) - Get it from your package manager, or from the [site itself](https://love2d.org/)
* If you're just trying to play the game, you don't need any of this since it'll work out of box as an executable

You can then run the project by using `love2d src` while in the directory (which can be obtained by either downloading the zip or cloning)

## Contributing
I'm going to hold off on this until July 5th when I have the foundation laid out. But as for some ground rules:
* No racism, I'd rather not end up being known as the guy who made some controversial game
* Read and abide by the CODE_OF_EXCELLENCY on maintaining yourself in the issue tracker and pull requests
* This project is licensed under the MIT, meaning you can fork it and do whatever you want. Though if you break the above rules in doing so, I'll have no part in it
